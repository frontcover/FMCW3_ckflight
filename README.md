**⚡ FMCW Radar Control and Data Acquisition on FPGA**

This project implements the complete digital backend of an FMCW radar system using VHDL and Xilinx MicroBlaze, integrating ramp control, ADC sampling, FIR decimation, and high-speed USB 2.0 streaming to a PC.

**🔧 System Architecture**

The design separates slow-control and high-speed signal processing into two domains:

**MicroBlaze Subsystem:**
Handles low-speed configuration of on-board ICs (ADF4158 PLL, amplifier) through GPIO, SPI, and UART interfaces.
Generates control signals such as ramp start, ramp configured, and sampling done flags.

**Vitis code will be developed under the folder FMCW3_Microblaze**

**FPGA Logic Subsystem:**
Dedicated to high-speed ADC data acquisition and USB 2.0 data transfer to the host PC using an FT2232H in synchronous FIFO mode. Main modules of fpga design are:

**microblaze_wrapper.vhd** — Soft CPU subsystem with AXI peripherals for SPI, GPIO, and UART. Handles configuration of the ADF4158 PLL, ADC, and peripheral devices.

**config.vhd** — Receives radar configuration packets from the host PC over USB; verifies framing and transfers parameters to MicroBlaze; asserts config_done when complete.

**control.vhd** — Main FSM that coordinates ADC sampling during ramp (MUXOUT = 1), USB transmission during gap, and controls PA enable and ADC OE/SHDN lines.

**adc.vhd** — Dual-phase ADC interface performing interleaved capture of two channels. Includes fir_compiler_0 IP cores (g_fir.fir1, g_fir.fir2) for low-pass filtering and ×20 decimation, generating synchronized data_a / data_b outputs.

**usb_sync.vhd** — Implements the FT2232H synchronous FIFO interface for USB 2.0 data transfer.

Contains two fifo_generator_0 IP cores: rx_dcfifo – Receives configuration data from PC (RX path). tx_dcfifo – Buffers outgoing ADC samples to USB (TX path).

**clk_wiz_0** — MMCM generating both 40 MHz (logic) and 100 MHz (MicroBlaze) clock domains with phase alignment.

**ila_0** — Integrated Logic Analyzer core used for hardware-level probing of control FSM states, ADC valid pulses, and USB FIFO activity.

**🧩 Simulation Results**


**Configuration Path:** Sequential byte reception over USB (config.vhd) forming correct 64-bit packets.

**Sampling & Control:** Proper sequencing of ADC sampling during ramp (MUXOUT = 1) and data upload during gap.

**ADC Behavior:** FIR-filtered and decimated dual-channel outputs synchronized with valid pulses.
